              Hello! I am  a doctoral candidate in History at the University of Chicago specializing in the history of modern China. 
              My research intersts include agricultural, environmental, and economic history, the history of science and technology, and digital history.
            </p>
            <p>
              My research focuses on the history of agriculture, science, and economy in modern China. 
              My dissertation, “Seeds of Construction: Cotton, Science, and Economic Change in Twentieth-Century China,” explores how China came to dominate the global cotton economy by the 1980s. 
            
            I argue that its rise relied on over half a century of scientific research, along with the development of different social technologies to control the cultivation, processing, and marketing of cotton.
            An expanded section of my dissertation looking at cotton improvement in interwar Shandong was recently published in Twentieth Century China. 
            My research is also interested in reevaluating conventional assumptions about the development and transmission of “modern” agricultural science. 
            In 2019, I published an article on how USDA botanists purchased and translated old Chinese agronomic texts in the 1920s and 1930s as a means to improve American agriculture.  
            I adopt a mixed methods approach to my research, combining close readings of qualitative materials with the analysis of quantitative data. 
            My research subsequently engages with ongoing developments in the growing field of digital history.  
            As a part of my research, I am currently involved in two digital history/humanities projects. 
            The first is a prosopographical database of Chinese agricultural scientists built with historians at Nanjing Agricultural University. 
            The second is a large-scale periodicals database developed in partnership with the Shanghai Library and the University of Chicago Textual Optics Lab.

              My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, Fulbright (IIE), Economic History Association,
              Henry Luce Foundation/ACLS, Esherick-Ye Family Foundation, D. Kim Foundation, the Center for Chinese Studies (National Central Library in Taiwan), and the Center for East Asian Studies at the University of Chicago. 
              My dissertation was most recently awarded a Michael and Ling Markovitz Dissertation Fellowship and a Research Grant from the Council on Advanced Studies at the University of Chicago.
