                  <p class="card-text">
                    My dissertation seeks to answer how China, a relatively minor player in the global cotton economy in the early twentieth century, came to dominate global cotton production and manufacturing today. 
              The emergence of the European-dominated "empire of cotton" in the nineteenth century had led to a decline in exports of Chinese cotton textiles. 
              As cotton production and manufacturing began to shift back to Asia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, reformers in China prioritized cotton textiles for economic and industrial development. 
              The rapid expansion of cotton mills c. World War I led to an increased demand for standardized "American" upland cotton (G. hirsutum) to feed its factories. 
              By looking at the introduction and diffusion of American cotton in China, my dissertation shows that the first half of the twentieth century served as an important social laboratory 
              for the introduction of new seeds, expansion of scientific research, and the development of new social technologies aimed at improving cotton production – 
              all of which propelled China’s growth during the second half of the twentieth century. 
              China's domination of the global cotton industry wasn't simply a product of its opening up to the global economy beginning in the late 1970s. 
              Instead, its success built on over half a century of scientific and agricultural experimentation.

                        A Community Crop: Cotton, Science, and Extension in Interwar Shandong, 1918-1937
                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        This article explores the impact of agricultural science and extension on the cotton industry in interwar Shandong Province. 
                        It shows that cotton experts played an important role in breeding upland or “American” cotton and in organizing communities to maintain the quality of the improved varieties. 
                        In the 1910s and early 1920s, cotton experts focused primarily on acclimatizing and improving American cotton varieties. 
                        Early approaches to distributing improved varieties failed to account for the difficulties of maintaining seed purity. 
                        Subsequently, in the 1930s, cotton scientists and extension agents worked together with industrialists, bankers, local government, rural reformers, and farmers to promote production and marketing cooperatives to manage how cotton was grown, ginned, and sold in a given community. 
                        These regulatory measures helped prevent seed degeneration and produced large supplies of pure-seed cotton for local production and factory consumption.

                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        This paper is a study of USDA botanist Walter Tennyson Swingle and his plant exploration efforts in China during the first half of the twentieth century. 
                        Swingle viewed China as a rich source of both germplasm and traditional knowledge that could enrich U.S. agriculture. 
                        He oversaw the collection and translation of old Chinese agronomic texts to guide agricultural explorers in China and search for inspiration to resolve contemporary problems. 
                        Swingle’s work highlights the multi-dimensional nature of U.S.-China agricultural exchange during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, 
                        and suggests greater attention needs to be paid to the impact of traditional Chinese knowledge on the development of U.S. agriculture.
